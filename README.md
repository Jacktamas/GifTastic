# Gif-Tastic
Gif-Tastic is a web app where users can search for GIPHY images. They can click on a pre-made words created by Gif-Tastic or they can add their own words!
When users click on a button, the page should populate 10 static non-animated gif images. When users click on one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the users click the gif again, it should stop playing.
